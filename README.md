# Would You Rather App for Udacity Project

This project requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  The source can be downloaded or clone from https://github.com/7100SW/would-you-quiz.git  

Follow these steps to build and run the project:

1. Retrieve the source code from my Github repository
2. Run `yarn install` in the project root directory. (Alternatively, you can use `npm install`.)
3. Run `yarn start` to launch the application.  (Alternatively, you can also use `npm start`.)


## How to login for Testing

The app will prompt the user to enter their username and password. For these build, we have hard code a few users account:

- sarahedo
- tylermcginnis
- johndoe

To make repeated testing easier, the username in the login screen defaults to johndoe.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
